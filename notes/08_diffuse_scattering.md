# Chapter 9 – Diffuse Reflection

## What Changed

Instead of coloring by normal,
we simulate light bouncing.

## Key Ideas

- Random hemisphere scattering
- Recursive ray tracing
- Energy attenuation (0.5 factor)
- Depth limiting

## Insight

Rendering is solving the light transport equation using Monte Carlo methods.

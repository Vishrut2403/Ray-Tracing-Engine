# Chapter 7 – Hittable Abstraction

## Why Refactored

Hardcoding sphere intersection does not scale.

We introduced:
- hit_record struct
- hittable abstract class
- sphere inheriting from hittable

## Key Concept

Polymorphism allows multiple object types to share a common interface.

## Insight

We are transitioning from demo code to engine architecture.
